# Results: 
###### 1. From The Number of Retiring Employees by Title Analysis
* 90,398 employees will be retiring in the near future
* 64% of employees retiring in senior positions.
* Only 2 managers are due to retire.
###### 2.The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program Analysis
* 1,549 employees set to retire are eligible for the mentorship program

 ### Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title 
 
 Using the ERD created as a reference, a Retirement Titles and count of Retiring Titles tables that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 is created by writing SQL queries. 
 
 * Retirement Titles Table queries emp_no, first_name, and last_name columns from the Employees table(employees.csv) and title, from_date, and to_date columns from the Titles table by joining the tables on the primary key. Then the data is filtered on the birth_date column to retrieve the employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Then, ordered by the employee number.
 * Unique Titles Table is then created by querying the Retirement Titles Table to retrieve the employee number, first and last name, and title columns using DISTINCT ON statement.
